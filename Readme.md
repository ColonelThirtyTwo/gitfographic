Gitfographic
============

Make infographics from your Git repo's history!

This works a lot like `git log --graph`, gitk, etc., but instead of outputing
the data to a color-less terminal or a window, it outputs to a scaleable, printable
SVG file.

Requirements
------------

 * Python (tested with 2.7, but 3.* should work as well)
 * [svgwrite](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/svgwrite)

Usage
-----

Run `python gitfograph.py -h` for command line options
